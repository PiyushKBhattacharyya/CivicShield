# CivicShield - AI-Driven Threat Detection & Crisis Management Platform

## Overview
CivicShield is a SaaS platform designed for government defense and homeland security agencies to monitor, detect, and manage emerging threats in real time.

## Key Features
- Multi-source data fusion: Aggregates data from social media, IoT sensors, satellite feeds, emergency calls, and intelligence reports
- AI-powered threat analysis: Uses natural language processing and pattern recognition to detect emerging risks
- Real-time alerts and dashboards: Situational awareness tools with geospatial visualization
- Integrated crisis response workflows: Automated protocols for incident escalation and resource deployment
- Secure communication channels: Encrypted messaging among authorized agencies
- Post-incident analytics and reporting: For after-action review and policy improvement

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React, Chakra UI, Mapbox GL JS
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, Elasticsearch
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, Transformers, Scikit-learn
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/Azure
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket, Kafka
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Data Flow

The CivicShield platform ingests data from multiple sources:

1. **IoT Sensors**: Environmental and security sensors
2. **Social Media**: Twitter, Facebook, and public forums
3. **Satellite Feeds**: Geospatial imagery and telemetry
4. **Emergency Calls**: 911 and emergency response systems
5. **Intelligence Reports**: Classified and unclassified intelligence
6. **Network Monitoring**: Cyber threat detection systems

Data is processed through:
- Real-time validation and normalization
- AI/ML threat analysis
- Correlation with existing threat data
- Storage in appropriate databases
- Distribution to authorized users
