## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- GPU support (recommended for training)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/civicshield.git
   cd civicshield/ai
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download required NLTK data:
   ```bash
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('vader_lexicon'); nltk.download('punkt')"
   ```

5. Start the AI service:
   ```bash
   python threat_detection.py
   ```

### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t civicshield-ai .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 civicshield-ai
   ```

## Models

### Threat Detection Model

The threat detection model analyzes various data sources to identify potential threats:

- **Social Media Analysis**: Uses NLP to analyze social media posts for threat indicators
- **IoT Sensor Data Analysis**: Identifies anomalies in sensor data that may indicate security breaches
- **Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Detects changes in satellite imagery that may indicate threats
- **Text Classification**: Classifies text documents for threat level

### NLP Models

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment of text to identify potential unrest
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifies people, organizations, and locations in text
- **Topic Modeling**: Groups related content to identify trending themes

### Pattern Recognition Models

- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical models to identify outliers in data
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicts future values based on historical patterns
- **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together

## Data Processing

### Data Sources

The AI/ML components process data from multiple sources:

1. **Social Media Feeds**: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram
2. **IoT Sensors**: Security cameras, motion sensors, environmental sensors
3. **Satellite Feeds**: Satellite imagery and telemetry
4. **Emergency Calls**: 911 and emergency service calls
5. **Intelligence Reports**: Classified and unclassified intelligence reports

### Data Preprocessing

- **Text Cleaning**: Removing noise from text data
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifying relevant features for analysis
- **Normalization**: Scaling data to consistent ranges
- **Encoding**: Converting categorical data to numerical representations

## Training

### Model Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather training data from various sources
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for training
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms for the task
4. **Training**: Train models on prepared data
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance on test data
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters
7. **Deployment**: Deploy trained models to production

### Training Scripts

Training scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory:

- `train_threat_detection.py`: Trains the threat detection model
- `train_nlp_models.py`: Trains NLP models
- `train_pattern_recognition.py`: Trains pattern recognition models

### Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using standard metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive identifications that were correct
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives that were identified
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Deployment

The AI/ML components can be deployed as a microservice using Docker and Kubernetes.

### API Endpoints

The AI service provides the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/threats/detect`: Analyze data for threats
- `POST /api/v1/nlp/analyze`: Perform NLP analysis on text
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/detect`: Identify patterns in data
- `GET /api/v1/models/status`: Get model status and performance metrics

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for deployment:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `MODEL_PATH`: Path to trained models
- `API_KEY`: API key for authentication
