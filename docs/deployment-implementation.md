## Deployment Overview

The CivicShield platform deployment process is designed to ensure high availability, security, and reliability while maintaining compliance with government standards. The deployment process follows a DevOps approach with automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.

### Deployment Goals

1. **Zero Downtime**: Minimize service disruption during deployments
2. **Security**: Maintain security throughout the deployment process
3. **Reliability**: Ensure consistent and reliable deployments
4. **Scalability**: Support scalable deployment processes
5. **Compliance**: Maintain compliance with government regulations

### Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture consists of:

- **Source Control**: Git repository with branch protection rules
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated pipeline for building, testing, and deploying
- **Container Registry**: Docker image storage and management
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of deployments and services
- **Security**: Security scanning and compliance checks

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment

**Purpose**: Developer testing and feature development

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal resources for cost efficiency
- Latest code changes
- Accessible to all development team members
- Synthetic/test data only
- Ephemeral, created/destroyed as needed

**Deployment Frequency**: Continuous deployment for all changes

### Staging Environment

**Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation

**Characteristics**:
- Mirror of production environment
- Accessible to QA team and select stakeholders
- Anonymized production data
- Persistent environment with regular updates

**Deployment Frequency**: Daily deployments of changes

### Production Environment

**Purpose**: Live system serving end users

**Characteristics**:
- High availability and optimized performance
- Authorized personnel only
- Real production data
- Persistent, 24/7 availability

**Deployment Frequency**: Controlled deployments with manual approval

### Disaster Recovery Environment

**Purpose**: Backup systems for disaster recovery

**Characteristics**:
- Geographically distributed backup systems
- Regular synchronization with production
- Activated during disaster scenarios
- Maintained with compliance requirements

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

**Description**: Maintain two identical production environments

**Process**:
1. Deploy new version to inactive environment (green)
2. Test and validate in green environment
3. Switch traffic to green environment
4. Monitor for issues
5. If issues arise, switch back to blue environment

**Benefits**:
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Quick rollback capability
- Real traffic testing

### Canary Deployment

**Description**: Gradually roll out changes to small subset of users

**Process**:
1. Deploy new version to small percentage of users
2. Monitor metrics and user feedback
3. Gradually increase percentage of users
4. Full rollout or rollback based on results

**Benefits**:
- Reduced risk of deployment issues
- Real user feedback before full rollout
- Controlled exposure

### Rolling Update

**Description**: Incrementally update instances in a deployment

**Process**:
1. Update one instance at a time
2. Validate each update
3. Continue updating instances
4. Maintain service availability during deployment

**Benefits**:
- Kubernetes-native deployment strategy
- Maintain service availability
- Gradual rollout

### Feature Flags

**Description**: Controlled feature rollout using flags

**Process**:
1. Implement feature flags in code
2. Deploy code with flags disabled
3. Enable flags for specific users or groups
4. Gradually enable for all users
5. Remove flags when feature is stable

**Benefits**:
- Controlled feature rollout
- Easy rollback of features
- A/B testing capabilities

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Checkout**: Retrieve latest code from repository
2. **Security Scan**: Scan code for vulnerabilities
3. **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests for individual components
4. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
5. **Code Quality Checks**: Linting and complexity analysis
6. **Build Artifacts**: Build container images
7. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploy to staging environment
8. **Automated Testing**: Run tests in staging environment
9. **Security Verification**: Verify security in staging
10. **Performance Testing**: Load testing with realistic traffic
11. **Manual Approval**: Manual approval for production deployment
12. **Deploy to Production**: Deploy to production environment

### Pipeline Configuration

## Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform Configuration

The infrastructure is managed using Terraform with the following components:

1. **Network Configuration**:
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
   - Subnets for different services
   - Security groups and network ACLs
   - Internet gateway and NAT gateways

2. **Compute Resources**:
   - Kubernetes cluster configuration
   - Node pools for different workloads
   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Load balancers

3. **Storage Configuration**:
   - Database instances
   - File storage for logs and backups
   - Object storage for static assets
   - Cache clusters

4. **Security Configuration**:
   - IAM roles and policies
   - Key management service
   - Certificate management
   - Security group rules

### Configuration Management

Configuration management is handled through:

1. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
2. **Configuration Files**: Non-sensitive configuration stored in configuration files
3. **Secrets Management**: Secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault or cloud provider's secrets manager
4. **Service Discovery**: Services discover each other through DNS or service registry

   - Performance degradation beyond thresholds
   - Security incidents detected

2. **Rollback Process**:
   - Identify previous stable version
   - Execute rollback script
   - Validate rollback success
   - Monitor system stability

### Manual Rollback

1. **When to Use**:
   - Automated rollback fails
   - Complex issues requiring manual intervention
   - Compliance-related rollbacks

2. **Rollback Steps**:
   - Identify root cause of issue
   - Determine rollback target version
   - Execute rollback procedures
   - Validate system functionality
   - Monitor for stability

### Rollback Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Rollback script for CivicShield platform

# Set variables
NAMESPACE="civicshield"
TARGET_VERSION="v1.0.0" # Replace with actual target version

# Rollback deployment
echo "Rolling back to version $TARGET_VERSION..."

# Rollback backend deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/civicshield-backend -n $NAMESPACE --to-revision=$TARGET_VERSION

# Rollback frontend deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/civicshield-frontend -n $NAMESPACE --to-revision=$TARGET_VERSION

# Rollback AI service deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/civicshield-ai -n $NAMESPACE --to-revision=$TARGET_VERSION

# Wait for rollback to complete
echo "Waiting for rollback to complete..."
kubectl rollout status deployment/civicshield-backend -n $NAMESPACE
