## Architecture Overview

CivicShield is a comprehensive platform designed for government defense and homeland security agencies to monitor, detect, and manage emerging threats in real time.

### Key Components

2. **AI/ML Processing Layer**: Uses natural language processing and pattern recognition to detect emerging risks or coordinated threats early.

3. **Alerting and Notification System**: Provides real-time alerts and dashboards for situational awareness with geospatial visualization.

4. **Incident Management System**: Implements automated protocols for incident escalation, resource deployment, and inter-agency coordination.

5. **Secure Communication Channels**: Offers encrypted messaging and data sharing among authorized agencies.

6. **Analytics and Reporting**: Provides post-incident analytics and reporting for after-action review, compliance, and policy improvement.
