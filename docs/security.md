## Security Architecture

CivicShield implements a comprehensive security architecture based on industry best practices and government security standards.

### Key Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Users and systems have minimum necessary access
3. **Zero Trust**: Continuous verification of all users and devices
4. **Security by Design**: Security integrated into all phases of development

### Security Domains

1. **Identity and Access Management**
2. **Data Protection**
3. **Network Security**
4. **Application Security**
5. **Infrastructure Security**
6. **Monitoring and Logging**

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

CivicShield supports multiple authentication methods:

- **Username/Password**: Traditional authentication with strong password policies
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Integration with government identity providers
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: For high-security roles
- **Biometric Authentication**: For field agents using mobile devices

### Password Security

- Minimum 12-character passwords
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Password expiration policies
- Password history to prevent reuse
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization

CivicShield implements role-based access control (RBAC) with the following features:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Predefined roles with specific permissions
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Dynamic access based on user attributes
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Access**: Temporary elevation of privileges
- **Segregation of Duties**: Prevention of conflicts of interest

### User Roles and Permissions

1. **Administrator**: Full system access
2. **Security Analyst**: Threat monitoring and analysis
3. **Incident Commander**: Crisis management and response
4. **Field Agent**: On-ground reporting and execution
5. **Intelligence Officer**: Intelligence data access and analysis
6. **Audit Specialist**: Compliance and audit functions

## Data Protection

### Encryption

CivicShield implements encryption at multiple levels:

- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Client-Side Encryption**: For highly sensitive data
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

- Content inspection for sensitive data
- Policy-based controls for data transfer
- Endpoint protection for device-level DLP
- Network DLP for monitoring data flows

### Data Classification

CivicShield uses a four-level data classification system:

1. **Level 1 - Public**: Information that can be publicly released
2. **Level 2 - Internal**: Information for internal use only
3. **Level 3 - Sensitive**: Information that could cause harm if disclosed
4. **Level 4 - Classified**: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

## Network Security

### Perimeter Security

- **Next-Generation Firewalls**: Deep packet inspection and threat prevention
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)**: Real-time threat detection
- **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**: Protection against application-layer attacks
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection**: Mitigation of DDoS attacks

### Internal Security

- **Network Segmentation**: Isolation of different security domains
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Fine-grained network access controls
- **Zero-Trust Network Architecture**: Continuous verification of all network traffic
- **Secure Remote Access**: VPN and secure proxy access for remote users

### Secure Communication

- **End-to-End Encryption**: For all internal and external communications
- **Secure Messaging**: Encrypted messaging between authorized personnel
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevention of man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Protection against future key compromises

## Application Security

### Secure Development Practices

- **Secure Coding Standards**: Implementation of OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated code analysis
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Runtime security testing
- **Third-Party Component Security**: Scanning for vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Runtime Protection

- **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Real-time attack prevention
- **API Security**: Protection against API-based attacks
- **Container Security**: Security for containerized applications
- **Serverless Security**: Protection for serverless functions

### Vulnerability Management

- **Continuous Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning of all components
- **Patch Management**: Regular updates and security patches
- **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus on critical vulnerabilities
- **Third-Party Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of vendor security

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Security

- **Configuration Management**: Automated compliance checking
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Continuous monitoring of cloud security
- **Container Image Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment of container images
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**: Security scanning of infrastructure code

### Physical Security

- **Data Center Security**: Physical access controls and monitoring
- **Environmental Controls**: Protection against environmental threats
- **Hardware Security**: Tamper detection and prevention
- **Backup Security**: Protection of backup data and systems

## Compliance

CivicShield is designed to meet various government and industry compliance requirements:

### Government Standards

- **FedRAMP**: Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of NIST guidelines
- **FISMA**: Federal Information Security Management Act compliance
- **ITAR**: International Traffic in Arms Regulations compliance

### International Standards

- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **ISO 27017**: Cloud security controls

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan

CivicShield includes a comprehensive incident response plan with the following phases:

1. **Preparation**: Readiness activities and planning
2. **Identification**: Detection and analysis of security incidents
3. **Containment**: Limiting the impact of security incidents
4. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of security incidents
5. **Recovery**: Restoring systems and services
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis and improvement
