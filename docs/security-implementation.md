## Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Model
The CivicShield platform implements a Zero Trust security model with the following principles:

- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All users and devices must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources
- **Assume Breach**: The system assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network
- **Least Privilege**: Users and systems are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions
- **Micro-segmentation**: Network segmentation limits lateral movement of threats

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls are implemented:

- **Perimeter Security**: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and web application firewalls
- **Network Security**: Network segmentation, encryption, and monitoring
- **Endpoint Security**: Device management, anti-malware, and vulnerability management
- **Application Security**: Secure coding practices, input validation, and access controls
- **Data Security**: Encryption, tokenization, and data loss prevention
- **Identity Security**: Multi-factor authentication, privileged access management, and identity governance

## Authentication

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
All users are required to use MFA with the following options:

- **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)**: Google Authenticator, Authy, or similar apps
- **SMS-based Authentication**: One-time codes sent via SMS
- **Email-based Authentication**: One-time codes sent via email
- **Hardware Security Keys**: FIDO2/WebAuthn compliant security keys

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
The platform supports SSO integration with:

- **SAML 2.0**: For enterprise identity providers
- **OAuth 2.0**: For social login and third-party applications
- **OpenID Connect**: For modern identity providers

### Password Security
- **Minimum Length**: 12 characters
- **Complexity Requirements**: Mixed case, numbers, and special characters
- **Password History**: Prevent reuse of last 10 passwords
- **Expiration**: Passwords expire every 90 days
- **Lockout Policy**: Account locked after 5 failed attempts

### Session Management
- **Session Timeout**: 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Limited to 3 active sessions per user
- **Session Revocation**: Ability to revoke sessions remotely
- **Secure Cookies**: HttpOnly and Secure flags enabled

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The platform implements RBAC with the following roles:

- **Administrator**: Full system access
- **Security Analyst**: Threat monitoring and analysis
- **Incident Commander**: Incident management and coordination
- **Field Agent**: Field reporting and communication
- **Intelligence Officer**: Intelligence data access and analysis
- **Audit Specialist**: Audit logs and compliance reporting

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Additional access controls based on:

- **Security Clearance Level**: Levels 1-4 with corresponding data access
- **Geographic Location**: Access based on user location
- **Time-based Restrictions**: Access during specific time windows
- **Device Compliance**: Access based on device security posture

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary elevation of privileges
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for privileged access
- **Session Recording**: Recording of all privileged sessions
- **Credential Vaulting**: Secure storage of privileged credentials

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 encryption for all network communications
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key storage and management
- **Client-Side Encryption**: For highly sensitive data

### Data Classification
- **Level 1 - Public**: Non-sensitive data available to all users
- **Level 2 - Internal**: Sensitive data available to authorized internal users
- **Level 3 - Confidential**: Classified data with restricted access
- **Level 4 - Top Secret**: Highly classified data with strict access controls

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- **Content Inspection**: Automated scanning for sensitive data
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated enforcement of data handling policies
- **Endpoint Protection**: Device-level DLP for endpoint devices
- **Network DLP**: Network-level monitoring for data exfiltration

### Data Retention and Disposal
- **Active Data**: Retained for the duration of system operation
- **Archived Data**: Retained for 7 years for compliance purposes
- **Deleted Data**: Securely erased using NIST-compliant methods
- **Audit Trail**: Permanent retention of audit logs

## Network Security

### Network Segmentation
- **Micro-segmentation**: Fine-grained network segmentation
- **Zero Trust Network**: Software-defined perimeter implementation
- **Network Access Control**: Device authentication and authorization
