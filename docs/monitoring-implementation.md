## Monitoring Architecture

### Observability Stack
The CivicShield platform uses a comprehensive observability stack:

- **Prometheus**: Time-series database for metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization platform for creating dashboards
- **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and deduplication
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics engine for log storage
- **Logstash**: Log processing pipeline
- **Kibana**: Visualization platform for logs
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing system
- **Fluentd**: Log collection and forwarding

### Monitoring Components
- **Application Metrics**: Custom application metrics using Prometheus client libraries
- **System Metrics**: Node exporter for system-level metrics
- **Container Metrics**: cAdvisor for container resource usage
- **Kubernetes Metrics**: Kube-state-metrics for Kubernetes cluster state
- **Business Metrics**: Custom metrics for threat detection rates, incident response times, etc.

## Metrics Collection

### Infrastructure Metrics
- **CPU Utilization**: Percentage of CPU usage across all services
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption by each service
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write operations per second
- **Network Traffic**: Incoming and outgoing network traffic
- **Kubernetes Metrics**: Pod status, node health, container restarts

### Application Metrics
- **API Response Times**: Latency for each API endpoint
- **Error Rates**: HTTP error rates and exception counts
- **Throughput**: Requests per second for each service
- **Database Query Performance**: Query execution times and connection pool usage
- **Queue Depths**: Message queue sizes and processing latencies

### Business Metrics
- **Threat Detection Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly identified threats
- **False Positive Rates**: Percentage of incorrectly flagged threats
- **Incident Response Times**: Time from detection to first response
- **Resolution Times**: Time from detection to resolution
- **User Activity**: Login counts, feature usage, system adoption rates

### Custom Metrics Implementation
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Counter for tracking total requests
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
    'http_requests_total',
    'Total HTTP requests',
    ['method', 'endpoint', 'status']
)

# Histogram for tracking request duration
REQUEST_DURATION = Histogram(
    'http_request_duration_seconds',
    'HTTP request duration',
    ['method', 'endpoint']
)

# Gauge for tracking active users
ACTIVE_USERS = Gauge(
    'active_users',
    'Number of active users'
)
```

## Log Management

### Log Categories
- **Application Logs**: Custom application logs with structured data
- **System Logs**: OS-level logs (syslog, journalctl)
- **Security Logs**: Authentication logs, access control logs, audit trails
- **Infrastructure Logs**: Kubernetes events, container logs, network logs
- **Business Logs**: User activity logs, incident tracking, report generation logs

### Log Structure and Format
All logs follow a structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "backend-api",
  "component": "threat-detection",
  "message": "Threat detected",
  "context": {
    "threat_id": "uuid",
    "threat_type": "cyber",
    "severity": "high"
  },
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "span_id": "uuid"
}
```

### Log Retention Policy
- **Debug/Info Logs**: 30 days
- **Warning Logs**: 90 days
- **Error/Critical Logs**: 365 days
- **Security/Audit Logs**: 7 years (compliance requirement)

### Log Aggregation
Logs are collected and aggregated using the following pipeline:
1. **Log Shippers**: Fluentd agents on each node
2. **Log Processing**: Logstash for parsing, filtering, and enriching
3. **Log Storage**: Elasticsearch with retention policies
4. **Log Visualization**: Kibana dashboards

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Classification
- **Critical Alerts**: System downtime, security breaches, data loss
- **High Priority Alerts**: Performance degradation, service errors, resource exhaustion
- **Medium Priority Alerts**: Warning conditions, near-threshold events
- **Low Priority Alerts**: Informational events, maintenance notifications

### Alert Generation
- **Metric-based Alerts**: Threshold-based alerts from Prometheus
- **Log-based Alerts**: Pattern-based alerts from ElastAlert
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Service availability monitoring

### Alert Routing and Management
- **Alertmanager**: Deduplication, grouping, and routing of alerts
- **Notification Channels**: 
  - Email notifications for low-priority alerts
  - SMS and push notifications for high-priority alerts
  - Slack/Teams integration for team notifications
  - PagerDuty integration for critical incident escalation

### Alert Suppression
- **Silencing**: Temporary alert suppression for known issues
- **Inhibition**: Preventing alerts based on other active alerts
- **Rate Limiting**: Preventing alert storms

## Dashboards

### System Health Dashboard
- Overall system status
- CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Kubernetes cluster health
- Service uptime and availability

### Application Performance Dashboard

### Custom Dashboard Implementation
Dashboards are created using Grafana with the following structure:

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "title": "CivicShield System Health",
    "panels": [
      {
        "title": "CPU Usage",
        "type": "graph",
        "targets": [
          {
            "expr": "rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!='idle'}[5m])",
            "legendFormat": "{{instance}}"
          }
        ]
