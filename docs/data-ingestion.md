# Data Ingestion in CivicShield Platform

## Overview

The CivicShield platform implements a comprehensive data ingestion system that collects, processes, and analyzes data from multiple sources to detect and respond to threats in real-time. This document explains how the data ingestion system works and how it integrates with the overall threat detection and crisis management capabilities of the platform.

## Data Sources

The CivicShield platform ingests data from the following sources:

1. **IoT Sensors**: Environmental sensors, security cameras, motion detectors, and other IoT devices
2. **Social Media**: Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms
3. **Satellite Feeds**: Geospatial imagery and telemetry data
4. **Emergency Calls**: 911 and emergency response systems
5. **Intelligence Reports**: Classified and unclassified intelligence reports from agencies
6. **Network Monitoring**: Cyber threat detection systems
7. **Physical Security**: Access control systems, perimeter sensors, etc.

## Data Ingestion Architecture

### 1. API Endpoints

The platform provides RESTful API endpoints for secure data ingestion:

```
POST /api/v1/data/threats          # Submit threat reports
POST /api/v1/data/sensors/data     # Submit sensor data
POST /api/v1/data/intel/reports    # Submit intelligence reports
POST /api/v1/data/emergency/calls # Submit emergency call data
POST /api/v1/data/social/feed      # Submit social media data
POST /api/v1/data/satellite/imagery # Submit satellite data
```

### 2. Real-time Streaming

For real-time data sources, the platform uses WebSocket connections:

```
WebSocket: ws://civicshield.example.com/api/v1/streaming
```

### 3. Batch Processing

For large datasets, the platform supports batch processing through file uploads:

```
POST /api/v1/data/batch
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Validation

All incoming data is validated for:
- Format compliance
- Data integrity
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting

### 2. Data Normalization

Data is normalized to standard formats:
- Timestamps are converted to UTC
- Geolocation data is standardized
- Text data is cleaned and encoded
- Numerical data is validated and scaled

### 3. Data Enrichment

Additional context is added to data:
- Geolocation enrichment with address information
- Timestamp enrichment with timezone information
- Entity extraction from text data
- Cross-referencing with existing threat databases

### 4. Threat Analysis

Data is analyzed for threats using:
- AI/ML models for pattern recognition
- Natural language processing for text analysis
- Statistical analysis for anomaly detection
- Correlation engines for linking related threats

### 5. Storage

Processed data is stored in appropriate databases:
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational data (users, agencies, incidents)
- **TimescaleDB**: Time-series data (sensor readings)
- **Elasticsearch**: Searchable text data (reports, social media)

## Implementation Details

### Backend Services

The data ingestion is handled by several backend services:

1. **Data Ingestion Service** (`backend/services/data_ingestion.py`):
   - Processes incoming data from all sources
   - Validates and normalizes data
   - Stores data in appropriate databases

2. **Streaming Service** (`backend/services/streaming.py`):
   - Handles real-time WebSocket connections
   - Processes continuous data streams
   - Broadcasts alerts to connected clients

3. **AI/ML Service** (`ai/threat_detection.py`):
   - Analyzes data for threats using machine learning
   - Detects anomalies in sensor data
   - Analyzes social media for threat indicators
   - Identifies patterns in threat data

### API Endpoints

The data ingestion API endpoints are defined in:
- `backend/routers/data_ingestion.py`
- `backend/schemas/data_ingestion.py`

### Database Models

Data is stored using the following database models:
- `backend/models/threat.py`: Threat and incident data
- `backend/models/sensor.py`: Sensor data
- `backend/models/user.py`: User and agency data

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

All data ingestion requires authentication:
- API keys for system-to-system communication
- JWT tokens for user authentication
- Certificate-based authentication for high-security integrations

### Encryption

Data is encrypted in transit and at rest:
- TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- AES-256 encryption for stored data
- Client-side encryption for highly sensitive data

### Access Control

Data access is controlled through:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Just-in-time access for temporary elevated privileges

## Monitoring and Logging

### Data Flow Monitoring

All data ingestion is monitored:
- Real-time metrics on data volume and processing rates
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring of processing pipelines

### Audit Logging

All data ingestion is logged:
- Detailed logs of all data submissions
- Access logs for audit trails
- Compliance reporting for regulatory requirements

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling

The data ingestion system is designed for horizontal scaling:
- Load balancing across multiple instances
- Database sharding for large datasets
- Caching for frequently accessed data

### Performance Optimization

Performance is optimized through:
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical data
- Database connection pooling
- Efficient data indexing and querying

## Integration Examples

### IoT Sensor Integration

```python
import websocket
import json

# Connect to WebSocket endpoint
ws = websocket.WebSocket()
ws.connect("ws://civicshield.example.com/api/v1/streaming")

# Send sensor data
sensor_data = {
    "type": "sensor_data",
    "payload": {
        "sensor_id": "sensor-001",
        "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
        "data": {
            "temperature": 25.5,
            "humidity": 60.2
        }
    }
}

ws.send(json.dumps(sensor_data))
ws.close()
```

### Social Media Integration

```python
import requests

# Submit social media post for analysis
url = "http://civicshield.example.com/api/v1/data/social/feed"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

post_data = {
    "post_id": "post-001",
    "platform": "twitter",
    "content": "Potential threat in downtown area",
    "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    "location": "40.7128,-74.0060"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=post_data, headers=headers)
```

## Conclusion

The CivicShield platform's data ingestion system is designed to handle multiple data sources with high security and reliability. Through a combination of API endpoints, real-time streaming, and batch processing, the platform can ingest data from any source and process it through advanced threat detection algorithms to identify and respond to potential threats.
